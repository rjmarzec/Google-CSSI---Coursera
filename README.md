# Google-CSSI-Coursera---Algorithmic_Toolbox_and_Data_Structures
 
 My solutions in python for the practice problems in Coursera's Algorithmic Toolbox and Data Structures Specializations. Not all problems were completed, so some problems will only consist of the template files, as well as the empty template files for other problems for each language. My completion certificates are in the repository as well.

These courses were taken as a part of Google's 2019 Summer CSSI-Coursera program, and can be found at https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox and https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures.
